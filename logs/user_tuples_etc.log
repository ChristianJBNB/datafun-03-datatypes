2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 Task 5. Tuples and More
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 Working with tuples, sets, and dictionaries
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 Tuple of home team jersey numbers tuple_home_team = (15, 22, 23, 40, 77)
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 Tuple of away team jersey numbers tuple_away_team = (14, 15, 25, 30, 33)
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 Here is the entire collection of jersey numbers for the two teams (15, 22, 23, 40, 77, 14, 15, 25, 30, 33)
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 Here is the total collection of jersey numbers multiplied by 5 (15, 22, 23, 40, 77, 14, 15, 25, 30, 33, 15, 22, 23, 40, 77, 14, 15, 25, 30, 33, 15, 22, 23, 40, 77, 14, 15, 25, 30, 33, 15, 22, 23, 40, 77, 14, 15, 25, 30, 33, 15, 22, 23, 40, 77, 14, 15, 25, 30, 33)
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 T/F: The jersey number 15 is on the home team: True
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 T/F: The jersey number 16 is on the away team: False
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 The third jersey number of the home team is 23 and the fourth number of the away team is 30
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 Quotient: 5, Remainder: 7
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 Here is the list of the top 5 all time leading scores in NBA history: {'Michael Jordan', 'Karl Malone', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Lebron James', 'Kareem Abdul-Jabbar'}
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 Here is the list of the top 5 current leading scores in NBA history: {'Russell Westbrook', 'James Harden', 'Chris Paul', 'Lebron James', 'Kevin Durant'}
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 Here are the two sets combined into one {'Kareem Abdul-Jabbar', 'Karl Malone', 'Lebron James', 'Russell Westbrook', 'James Harden', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Chris Paul', 'Kevin Durant', 'Michael Jordan'}
2023-05-26 13:58:52,871 Here are the intersections of the two sets {'Lebron James'}
2023-05-26 13:58:52,875 Here are the key-value pairs of each word and its count from the text_woodchuck.txt file: {'How': 1, 'much': 3, 'wood': 2, 'would': 3, 'a': 4, 'woodchuck': 4, 'chuck': 4, 'if': 2, 'could': 2, 'wood?': 1, 'He': 1, 'chuck,': 1, 'he': 2, 'would,': 1, 'as': 4, 'could,': 1, 'and': 1, 'wood.': 1}
